MacFixer by Noobz
-----------------

This is a little utility to help all of those who are too lazy to manually
change their MAC address back to the correct value. This can be of use for
people that have changed Wifi boards in the PSP, or if they have changed the
MAC address manually.

NOTE: This only runs on M33 and OE firmwares and is not designed to run
      on 150.

Installation
------------
Copy the contents of MS_ROOT to the memory stick.

Running
-------
Ensure that Wifi is enabled, then run MacFixer from the PSP game menu.

After running if the PSP has a mismatch of MAC address it will set it
back to the propper value.
